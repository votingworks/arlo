# Contribution Guidelines

When making a Pull Request, make sure to run through the following checklist:

_Function_

[] Code is fully functional and ready for review (or is tagged WIP)

[] No errors/warnings in the browser console ( ﾟヮﾟ)/

[] package.json is committed if I added or removed any dependencies

[] Tests added as needed to ensure code base still has 100% passing coverage

[] Tests added as needed to cover new functionality

_Style_

[] Passes linter without errors

[] Code is easily understandable and self-documenting (using naming conventions in keeping with the rest of the codebase)

[] Interfaces all have 'I' before their names (as in `IAudit`)

[] Comments are only included as needed to explain the 'why' instead of the 'what'

[] Common standards and coding practices are adhered to

[] DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. Code is reasonably structured to avoid repetition

[] Code is intuitively structured following a Separation of Concerns

[] No class components; only functional components (using Hooks as needed)

_Workflow_

[] Do an interactive rebase or a rebase
